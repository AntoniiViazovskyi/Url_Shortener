# URL Shortener
The "URL Shortener" project is a web service developed to convert long URLs into short ones. The user enters a long URL, and our service provides them with a unique shortened URL, which automatically redirects to the original long URL when accessed.

## To do
### Main Requirements:
 - [ ] The project must be implemented as a REST API.
 - [ ] The project must be presented in the form of API documentation (Swagger).
 - [ ] The API must have versioning: [https://www.baeldung.com/rest-versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-versioning).
 - [ ] Code coverage with tests: at least 80%.
### Requirements for Launch:
 - [ ] There must be two launch profiles, default and prod [https://www.baeldung.com/spring-profiles](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-profiles).
 - [ ] The default profile should have settings for local launch.
 - [ ] Prod for a remote server.
 - [x] The application must have a Dockerfile, and the local launch of the application (application + database) must be described in docker-compose.yml.
 - [ ] The database for tests must be launched using [https://java.testcontainers.org/](https://java.testcontainers.org/).
 - [x] All private information, such as login and password to the DB, must be in the form of environment variables: ```${DB_USERNAME}```.
 - [x] Environment variables must be described in the README.md file.
#### 1. Registration and Authentication of Users
##### Registration:
 - [ ] Check for the uniqueness of the username.
 - [ ] The password must contain at least 8 characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.
 - [ ] Storage of passwords in encrypted form.
##### Authentication:
 - [ ] Verification of entered data for correspondence with the data in the DB.
 - [ ] Upon successful authorization, return a JWT (JSON Web Token) that will be used for further authentication.
### 2. Short Link
 - [ ] Must contain a short link, original, creation date, the number of transitions made on it, and the user who created it.
 - [ ] The link must have an expiration date.
### 3. Creation of a Short Link
 - [ ] Only a registered user can create a short link.
 - [ ] The original link must be valid.
 - [ ] The system must generate a new short link (6-8 random letters/numbers).
 - [ ] The short and original links must be saved in the DB according to the user.
### 4. User Capabilities
 - [ ] The user must be able to view all created active links and statistics on them.
 - [ ] The user must be able to view all created links and statistics on them.
 - [ ] The user can create a new/delete an existing link.

### 5. Following the Link
 - [ ] Even an unregistered user can follow the shortened link.
 - [ ] The transition statistics must be updated.
 - [ ] The response must be cached.
## Improvements
 - [x] Implement a global exception handler using ```@ControllerAdvice``` and ```@ExceptionHandle``` annotations to manage exceptions across the entire application.
 - [ ] Thymeleaf Integration: Thymeleaf should be used as the server-side template engine for rendering HTML content.
